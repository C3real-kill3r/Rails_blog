# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running. The application is a simple blog app built with rails.

Things I want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization


* ...


## Installation
- Clone this repository to have the app on your machine with ```git clone https://github.com/C3real-kill3r/Rails_blog.git```
- Change directory to the app's root with ```cd Rails_blog```
- Then run ```bundle install```  to install the dependencies.
- Run ```rails db:migrate``` to migrate database tables.
- Run ```rails db:seed``` to update the categories table.
- Start the server by running ```rails s```
- Then visit ```http://localhost:3000``` to view the app
- Incase you want to modify some piece of the app, run in a separate terminal ```bundle excec guard``` so as to avoid refreshing the server/broswer whenever you make a change

### Gems used in the project

- [Better Errors](https://rubygems.org/gems/better_errors) - Easier on the eyes when it comes to errors.

- [Bulma](https://github.com/joshuajansen/bulma-rails) - Most of the time I would roll my own CSS or just use bits of a framework. I'm a big fan of bulma though.

- [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) - This gem is useful for live reloading our `scss`, `js`, `css`, and `erb` files, although it's capable of much more! *Guard is required for the Guard LiveReload gem to work*

  Add the following within the development space in the `Gemfile`. Make sure to run `bundle` and restart your server (covered in the video).

  ```ruby
  group :development do
    # Guard is a command line tool to easily handle events on file system modifications.
    gem 'guard', '~> 2.14', '>= 2.14.1'
  end
  ```


- [Guard LiveReload](https://github.com/guard/guard-livereload) - This gem depends on the Guard gem. I use this to automatically reload the browser when Guard senses changes within the code base.

  1. Download the [livereload browser extension](http://livereload.com/extensions/) for your browser.
  2. Add the following within the development space of the `Gemfile`. Make sure to run `bundle` and restart your server.

  ```ruby
  group :development do
    # reload the browser after changes to assets/helpers/tests
    gem 'guard-livereload', '~> 2.5', '>= 2.5.2', require: false
  end
  ```

  1. Run `guard init livereload`

  2. Be sure to comment out the following block in the `Guardfile if it gets generated for your project.

     ```ruby
     # comment this whole block out as we won't be making use if minitest
     # guard :minitest do
     # ....
     # end
     ```

  3. **Restart your server** once more for good measure. Run:

     ```ruby
     bundle exec guard
     ```

      to start the "watching" process within your project directory. We use `bundle exec` as a prefix here so guard has access to all of our dependences in the project. â€‹

  4. Make sure your browser extension is active when navigating to your app. If your console reads back something similar to the following, then you are in good shape.

     ```bash
     00:00:00 - INFO - LiveReload is waiting for a browser to connect.
     00:00:00 - INFO - Guard is now watching at '/path/to/your/project/'
     [1] guard(main)> 00:00:00 - INFO - Browser connected.
     ```

- [Simple Form](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form) - For simpler forms!

  Our final post form partial is as follows. Here I add bulma specific classes to get Simple Form to play nice with the CSS framework. If you use Simple Form with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) or [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/download.html/) you likely need even less markup than this.

  ```erb
  <div class="section">
  <%= simple_form_for @post do |f| %>
    <div class="field">
      <div class="control">
        <%= f.input :title, input_html: { class: 'input' }, wrapper: false, label_html: { class: 'label' } %>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="field">
      <div class="control">
        <%= f.input :content, input_html: { class: 'textarea' }, wrapper: false, label_html: { class: 'label' }  %>
      </div>
    </div>
    <%= f.button :submit, 'Create new post', class: "button is-primary" %>
  <% end %>
  </div>
  ```
